# renovate-config-asdf

## Usage

[Renovate sharable config](https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/) for [.tool-versions (asdf)](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins/tree/master/plugins).

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "extends": [
    "config:base",
    "github>kachick/renovate-config-asdf#1.0.0"
  ]
}
```

This example referenced stable version as `#1.0.0`. Versions can be checked in [github-tags](https://github.com/kachick/renovate-config-asdf/tags).
Because of default branch is frequently changed for developping.

If you want to narrow Renovate effect, for example you are basically using dependabot, removing `config:base` and specifying `enabledManagers` might fit.

Below is an actual example for me. It points default branch of this repository to use development version.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "extends": [
    "github>kachick/renovate-config-asdf"
  ],
  "labels": ["dependencies", "renovate"],
  "enabledManagers": ["regex"]
}
```

## Limitations

Want to cover asdf, however currently targeted only for github hosted and/or some compilers/interpreters.

- [asdf-zig](https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-zig) - I don't know why [it](plugins/zig.json5) does not work...
- [asdf-python](https://github.com/danhper/asdf-python) - Currently targeted only for [cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython)
- [asdf-java](https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java) - Looks needed to read [tsv](https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java/tree/master/data)
